# Mapping and Classification of Corals Distribution using Seabed Marine Data
Corals are distributed worldwide and can be mapped from seabed marine data. To predict whether a certain location of sea contains corals, the seabed data and sea water characteristics are used.

Using data from World Ocean Based Map Server which contains the most general and basic information about sea areas, I use machine learning model classifiers to predict potential corals habitats in marine areas and create interactive mapping.
